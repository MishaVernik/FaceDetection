# FaceDetection
LOSC 2 project, computer vision with python (openCV)
How to use:
1. If you want to add some faces to database, you must create folder for photos in images/
2. There are several ways how to add photos:
      1) make some photos with phone or camera(bad decision)
      2) make some photos with "main.py"(econom time and memory)
   So, open main.py however you want, then find 19th line and enter name of your folder. In the title of while-loop you can choose count of    photos, then run program
3. Find folders named pickles and recognizers and remove files into it, run "face-trainer.py"
4. Run "faces.py" and enjoy!
